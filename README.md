# Electrical Load & Cost Estimator (Egypt 2020 Code)

## 📌 Project Overview
An automated Python-based tool designed for electrical engineers in Egypt to calculate building loads and connection costs according to the *2020 Electricity Distribution Code*. This project bridges the gap between traditional engineering calculations and modern automation.

## 🚀 Key Features
- *Automatic Load Calculation:* Estimates design loads based on area, number of floors, and building type.
- *District-Based Logic:* Adjusts calculations according to geographical locations (Village vs. Urban) and neighborhood class (Standard, Middle, Posh).
- *Auxiliary Loads:* Seamlessly integrates power requirements for Elevators and Water Pumps.
- *Cost Estimation:* Automatically differentiates between *Standard (Flat rate)* and *Actual (Technical details)* estimation methods.
- *Transformer Room Checker:* Provides a decision-making logic on whether a dedicated transformer room is legally required.
- *Excel Integration:* Generates a professional, color-coded Excel report with all formulas active.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- *Python 3.x*
- *Pandas:* For data structure and logic handling.
- *XlsxWriter:* For professional Excel reporting and formatting.

## 📖 How to Use
1. Run the script in a Python environment (or Google Colab).
2. The tool will generate an Excel file named Electrical_Calculator_Pro.xlsx.
3. Enter your data in the *Yellow cells, and watch the **Green cells* update the results instantly.
